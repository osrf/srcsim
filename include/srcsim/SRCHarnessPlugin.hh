  /// \brief This plugin is designed to lower a model at a controlled rate.
  /// Joints between a harness model and a model to lower are created
  /// according to SDF provided to this plugin.
  ///
  /// A winch joint and detach joint can be specified. The winch joint,
  /// ideally a prismatic joint, has a PID controller. The detach joint,
  /// which can be the same joint as the winch joint, is detached on a given
  /// signal.
  ///
  /// Two topics are created:
  ///
  ///  1. ~/<plugin_model_name>/harness/velocity
  ///      - Message Type: GzString, expected to be a float
  ///      - Purpose: Set target winch velocity
  ///
  ///  2. ~/<plugin_model_name>/harness/detach
  ///      - Message Type: GzString, expected to be a bool ("true")
  ///      - Purpose: Detach the <detach> joint.
  ///
  ///  3. ~/<plugin_model_name>/harness/attach
  ///      - Message Type: Pose, world pose to be set for child link
  ///        before attaching
  ///      - Purpose: Attach the joint at the specified world pose
